# Blood-Donation-Website </br>
<p>This <b>"Blood Donation Website"</b> is a full-stack application built using the <b>MERN</b> stack <b>(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js),</b> where I used React.Js as a Frontend for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces and React Router for client-side routing and navigation. In Backend I used Node.js and Express creating robust APIs to handle user requests and interactions and also implements server-side routing for efficient request processing. In Database I used <b>MongoDB Cluster</b> for scalable and secure data storage. Mongoose for managing data schemas and interactions with the database. The aim is to provide a seamless platform for users to register as blood donors and for individuals in need of blood to search for donors based on specific criteria. In emergencies, users can quickly search for and contact suitable blood donors through the website.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Users can register themselves as blood donors by providing necessary details. Registered users can log in to their accounts to manage and edit their profiles to update their information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can search for blood donors by specifying their local address and blood group which makes it easy for users to find the right match quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    In this project, I implemented <b>"OTP (One-Time Password)"</b> verification to overcome user's forgot password issue which enhances the security and reliability of the password recovery process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Also I implemented hashing for passwords to ensure user data is securely stored and protect user credentials from unauthorized access.
  </li>
  <li>
    To store the data of registered donors I used MongoDB Cluster to ensures scalability and reliability of the database to handle user registrations and search queries.
  </li>
  <li>
    I implemented a <b>Razorpay</b> payment gateway to make secure financial contributions to support the platform or related causes through the integrated payment gateway.
