                            <strong>To make your donation as easy as possible and to avoid complications, follow these tips........</strong>
                            <br></br>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Sleep well:</strong>Try to arrive for your blood donation well-rested. Although everyone has different needs, aim for around 8 hours of sleep the night before.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong>Drink plenty of water. Before you donate, drink at least 16 ounces of water for the best blood donation experience. Drinking water helps reduce the risk of low blood pressure during blood donation, which is the most common cause of fainting. It also makes your veins easier to access and can speed up your donation. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can dehydrate you.</li>
                                <li><strong>Eat healthy:</strong>Avoid foods high in fat, like fries or ice cream. Donating blood can make your iron level dropâ€”you can prepare your body by eating foods rich in iron and vitamin C before you donate. Some examples of these kinds of foods include:
                                Beans and lentils, Nuts and seeds, Leafy greens like spinach or broccoli, Citrus fruits, Berries.</li>

                            Be <strong>between 16 and 60 years old.</strong> Weigh at least 45 kg. Have a haemoglobin level of at least 13.0 g/dl for males and 12.5 g/dl for females. During a regular donation, <strong>you will give around 470ml of whole blood.</strong> This is about 8% of the average adult's blood volume. The body replaces this volume within 24 to 48 hours, and replenishes red blood cells in 10 to 12 weeks.
